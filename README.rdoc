== Usage

=== Finding a batch of listings

the Nwmls::Listing#find method will return an array of Nwmls::Listing objects if given a hash. The possible keys for that hash are
  :property_type
  :status
  :county
  :area
  :city
  :begin_date
  :end_date
  :office_mls_id
  :agent_mls_id
  :bedrooms
  :bathrooms

eg. Nwmls::Listing.find(:property_type => "RESI", :status => "A", :city => "Seattle")

The options for :property_type are "RESI", "COND", "BUSO", "COMI", "FARM", "MANU", "MULT", "RENT", "VACL". If the :property_type key is not supplied then "RESI" is the default

There are subclasses of Nwmls::Listing based on the property types. Your result objects are returned as instances of these classes. You can also use find with these classes, for example
  Nwmls::Listing.find(:property_type => "COND")

is equivalent to
  Nwmls::CondominiumListing.find()

The supported subclasses are
  Nwmls::ResidentialListing #RESI
  Nwmls::CondominiumListing #COND
  Nwmls::BusinessOpportunityListing #BUSO
  Nwmls::CommercialListing #COMI
  Nwmls::FarmListing #FARM
  Nwmls::ManufacturedHomeListing #MANU
  Nwmls::MultiFamilyListing #MULT
  Nwmls::RentalListing #RENT
  Nwmls::VacantLandListing #VACL

* Filters
The find method also takes an optional second parameter. This is an array of filters. The filters work similarly to a select clause in a SQL statement. It limits which attributes are returned in the results. For example
  Nwmls::Listing.find(:status => "A", ['LN','PTYP',UD]) 
would return all active residential listings but only the listing_number, property_type, and update_date attributes.
This feature is useful when you are doing finds that return a large number of Listing objects

=== Finding a single listing by it's listing number
if you give find the key :listing_number then a single result will be returned instead of an array. Example:
  Nwmls::Listing.find(:listing_number => '454186')
conveniently you can also find a single listing with
  Nwmls::Listing.find(454186)
